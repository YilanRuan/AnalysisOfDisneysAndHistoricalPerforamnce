# 📊 Disney Revenue & Strategy Analysis

## 🎬 Project Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics project that investigates **Disney's historical revenue drivers** and evaluates **long-term strategic insights** through data analysis, statistical testing, and causal inference. The project explores:

- What factors contribute to Disney's movie box office success
- The impact of genre on revenue
- Audience preferences for heroes vs villains
- The effect of the Disney+ recommendation system on subscription growth

## 📈 What This Project Does

Using a combination of **hypothesis testing, ANOVA, causal analysis (DoWhy)**, and **regression models**, this project answers the following core questions:

1. **Movie Revenue Performance**: Do Disney's pre-2016 movies perform as well as post-2017 blockbusters?
2. **Genre Impact**: Which movie genres contribute most to revenue?
3. **Audience Preference Analysis**: Do age demographics influence preferences for heroes or villains?
4. **Disney+ Strategy**: Does the recommendation system increase Disney+ subscriber counts?

## 💡 Impact of This Analysis

- Provided Disney with **evidence-backed insights** to prioritize top-performing genres like **Action, Adventure, Musical, Romantic Comedy, Thriller/Suspense, and Western**.
- Demonstrated that **audience age groups (under/over 44)** do **not significantly differ** in their preference for heroes vs villains, guiding more generalized marketing strategies.
- Assessed the **causal impact of the Disney+ recommendation system**, revealing nuanced insights:
  - Linear regression suggested a **negative or inconclusive effect**.
  - However, using **Propensity Score Matching via DoWhy**, a **positive causal impact of +2,495 subscribers** was discovered, suggesting areas for optimization in recommendation algorithms.

| Box Office Revenue Comparison      | Hypothesis Testing                 | Pre-2016 movies do **not outperform** post-2017 releases                                 |
| Genre Performance                  | Welch ANOVA + Tukey                | Top 6 genres identified for higher revenue                                               |
| Age Preference for Heroes/Villains | Heterogeneity Test                 | No significant difference across age groups                                              |
| Disney+ Recommendation System      | Regression + DoWhy Causal Analysis | Weak evidence from regression, but causal analysis showed **positive subscriber growth** |
